Running only a hello-world is no fun. I'll try to create and run tests using `playwright` for an application with real functions.


### The application

### Test cases
#### Writing tests
#### Split into multiple files

### Configurations

### View test result

### Things learned
### The project
Find the project so far in [this repo](https://github.com/wei-y/test-playwright-js).

```bash
git chekcout 0.03 -b 0.03
```
